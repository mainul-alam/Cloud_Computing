# For Cental App

## Step 1 : Install "Xampp"

"Xampp" <- Givem me the web server (Apachi)
        <- Gives me the database (Mysql)

## Step 2 : Integration with Github

- Create a repository in github.
- Open git bash and clone the repository inside "Xampp/htdocs/" - folder(because this is the root).
- Cd into repository and use "composer" to create laravel project.
- Open editor ( VS code) and commit changes and push.(vs code already configured).
- After this start working with the CentralApp (go to CentalApp readme).
